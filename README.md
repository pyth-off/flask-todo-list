# Flask Tutorials from Flasky

This repository contains notes and a demo application primarily derived from the source code examples in the second edition of the O'Reilly book [Flask Web Development](http://www.flaskbook.com). The base code has been slightly modified for educational purposes and personal use.

The Docker image has been upgraded and modified to improve usability. Some Python commands have been updated, and there have been new developments in both Python and its components since this repository was published.
